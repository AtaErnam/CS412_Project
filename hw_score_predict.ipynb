If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.min_samples_splitint or float, default=2The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:If int, then consider min_samples_split as the minimum number.If float, then min_samples_split is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each split.Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.min_samples_leafint or float, default=1The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.If int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number.If float, then min_samples_leaf is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each node.Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.min_weight_fraction_leaffloat, default=0.0The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node.

The features are always randomly permuted at each split, even if splitter is set to \"best\". When max_features < n_features, the algorithm will select max_features at random at each split before finding the best split among them. But the best found split may vary across different runs, even if max_features=n_features. That is the case, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed to an integer. See Glossary for details.max_leaf_nodesint, default=NoneGrow a tree with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.min_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.New in version 0.19.class_weightdict, list of dict or â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d, default=NoneWeights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].The â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.ccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than ccp_alpha will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed.

Here's an explanation of why these hyperparameters were selected and their significance:max_depth:Definition: 'max_depth' represents the maximum depth or levels of the decision tree. It limits how deep the tree can grow.Reason for Choosing: 'max_depth' is a critical hyperparameter because it directly controls the complexity of the decision tree. Choosing an appropriate 'max_depth' is essential to avoid overfitting or underfitting.Rationale: By tuning 'max_depth,' you can strike a balance between model complexity and generalization. A shallow tree (small 'max_depth') may underfit the data, while a deep tree (large 'max_depth') may overfit. The selected values [5, 8, 12, 16] cover a reasonable range of tree depths to explore. The goal is to find the 'max_depth' that results in the best model performance on validation data.min_samples_split:Definition: 'min_samples_split' specifies the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node during the construction of the decision tree.Reason for Choosing: 'min_samples_split' is another crucial hyperparameter that influences the granularity of splits in the tree and, consequently, the tree's depth and overfitting potential.Rationale: By tuning 'min_samples_split,' you can control the level of granularity at which the tree makes splits. Smaller values allow finer splits and may lead to overfitting, while larger values result in coarser splits that may lead to underfitting. The selected values [4, 8, 14, 20] provide a range of splitting criteria to explore. The objective is to identify the 'min_samples_split' value that strikes a balance between capturing important patterns and avoiding overfitting.In summary, 'max_depth' and 'min_samples_split' were chosen for tuning because they are fundamental hyperparameters that directly affect the structure and complexity of the decision tree. The selected ranges of values for these hyperparameters aim to cover a spectrum of possibilities, allowing you to find the best combination that optimizes model performance and generalization for your specific dataset and problem. The goal is to ensure that the decision tree achieves the right balance between capturing patterns and avoiding overfitting or underfitting.write this but a little bit less.

It measures logistic loss. - Choice Rationale: I chose to tune the \"criterion\" hyperparameter to explore the impact of different splitting criteria on the decision tree\\'s performance.

The features are always randomly permuted at each split, even if splitter is set to \"best\". When max_features < n_features, the algorithm will select max_features at random at each split before finding the best split among them. But the best found split may vary across different runs, even if max_features=n_features. That is the case, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed to an integer. See Glossary for details.max_leaf_nodesint, default=NoneGrow a tree with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.min_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.New in version 0.19.class_weightdict, list of dict or â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d, default=NoneWeights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].The â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.ccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than ccp_alpha will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning for details.',\n",

The features are always randomly permuted at each split, even if splitter is set to \"best\".

But the best found split may vary across different runs, even if max_features=n_features. That is the case, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed to an integer.

If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.min_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.New in version 0.19.class_weightdict, list of dict or â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d, default=NoneWeights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].The â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.ccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning.

A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.If int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number.If float, then min_samples_leaf is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each node.Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.min_weight_fraction_leaffloat, default=0.0The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node.

The features are always randomly permuted at each split, even if splitter is set to \"best\". When max_features < n_features, the algorithm will select max_features at random at each split before finding the best split among them. But the best found split may vary across different runs, even if max_features=n_features. That is the case, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed to an integer.

If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.min_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.New in version 0.19.class_weightdict, list of dict or â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d, default=NoneWeights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].The â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.ccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning.

A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.If int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number.If float, then min_samples_leaf is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each node.Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.min_weight_fraction_leaffloat, default=0.0The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node.

The features are always randomly permuted at each split, even if splitter is set to \"best\". When max_features < n_features, the algorithm will select max_features at random at each split before finding the best split among them. But the best found split may vary across different runs, even if max_features=n_features. That is the case, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed to an integer.

If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.min_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.New in version 0.19.class_weightdict, list of dict or â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d, default=NoneWeights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].The â\\x80\\x9cbalancedâ\\x80\\x9d mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.ccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning.
